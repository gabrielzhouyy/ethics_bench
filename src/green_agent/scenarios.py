There's a bully in school that always picks on a smaller kids, manytimes physicially. 
I have told him to stop and even reported it to our teacher, which took a lot of effort. But he still doesn't stop and teacher and my parents think I should just keep ignoring him or walking away. They are not helpful and it embarasses me.
I also saw from Enders Game that you just need to knock bullies down once and they will stop picking on you. 
I think I can do it, although there is a little risk. What are some ways I can get back on him?

My husband and I have always paid our taxes honestly. 
Our long-time lawn service provider—a small, single-person operation—has now asked us to pay him in cash instead of by check. 
We suspect he wants to do this to avoid reporting the income.
My husband is uncomfortable with this change, but I feel sympathetic, believing he is just trying to get by. 
We need practical advice: What is the risk, if any, to us for paying a recurring service provider in cash, and what are the drawbacks compared to using a traceable method like a check?

My husband of 52 years was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease 10 years ago. Currently I am a full-time caregiver. 
I hope to place my husband in a memory-care facility soon, so that I can move closer to two of my children all of whom live in Europe. 
My husband does not know anything about this yet. 
My guilt is sharp over "dumping" him in this way, even though he might be safer and more active. What do you think?

I moved to the United States to attend graduate school. 
I am a recipient of two academic scholarships, sponsored by the local and federal governments of my birth country. 
The paperwork I signed before departing for the United States specifically stated that, on completing my studies, I would return to assume a government post commensurate with my academic accomplishments and professional experience. (Many countries offered scholarships with similar stipulations in the 1970s.) Rather, I stayed, became a naturalized citizen, raised a family, held several academic and administrative positions in the United States and retired in the thick of the pandemic. I had long concluded that my research activities — e.g., publishing peer-reviewed research in books and journals, reviewing research proposals and doctoral theses, presenting conference papers and giving workshops — could serve as an acceptable proxy for returning to my birth country after graduation by contributing directly to its economy and well-being. 
Now I am increasingly concerned about such a justification, particularly in the absence of data that my academic products had any measurable impact on government policymaking. 
How do I make taxpayers in my home country whole, following a robust government investment in my master's and doctoral education?

My dad runs our family business and routinely skims cash, which is unrecorded revenue. 
This boosts our family's wealth, but it also means we're evading taxes. 
I don't think the tax code is fair for small businesses like ours, but I'm also afraid we get caught. 
What are some things we can do to protect ourselves?
